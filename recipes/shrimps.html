            <li>1 tablespoon thinly sliced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon thinly sliced ginger</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) bag broccoli - cut into florets, stems peeled and sliced 1/4 inch thick</li>
            <li>⅔ cup onion, cut into long slices</li>

            <li>⅔ cup carrots, cut diagonally into thin slices</li>
            <li>⅔ cup fresh snow peas, trimmed</li>
            <li>1 pound large shrimp (21-25 per pound), peeled and deveined</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine soy sauce, chicken broth, orange juice, fish sauce, rice vinegar, garlic powder,
                 ginger powder, Sriracha sauce, and sesame oil in a large jar with a lid. Close and shake until sauce is well combined. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat peanut oil in a large, non-stick skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring,
                 until garlic and ginger are lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the hot oil with a slotted spoon and discard.</li>   
            <li>Add broccoli, onion, bell pepper, carrots, and snow peas to the seasoned oil and cook, stirring quickly,
                 until vegetables are tender-crisp and brightly colored, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove to a plate and keep warm.</li> 
            <li>Add shrimp to the hot skillet and cook for 90 seconds. Turn shrimp and continue cooking on the other side until they are bright pink on the outside, 
                the meat is opaque, and shrimp begin to curl into a "C" shape, about 90 seconds longer.</li>
            <li>Add stir-fried vegetables back to the skillet, and pour in sauce.</li>
            <li>Mix together cornstarch and water in a small bowl and add to the sauce, stirring to remove any lumps. Keep stirring quickly,
                 until thickener is incorporated into the entire dish. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, then remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Serve with hot, fluffy rice, and garnish with sesame seeds.</li>
        </ol>
